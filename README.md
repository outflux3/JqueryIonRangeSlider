## Jquery Ion Rangeslider for ProcessWire CMS

This is a simple module that allows you to enable the ion.Rangeslider on any text input, and then you type in your params into the textarea field (careful, you can break the page's javascrpt if you are not careful!) 

You can also load some presets that have been tested and should all work. For more examples, and options, you can visit Ionden demo site:
